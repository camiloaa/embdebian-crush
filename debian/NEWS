emdebian-tools (2.2.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  The emdebian-crush binary package has been slimmed down again for
  Squeeze. This release removes support for apt-cross which has been
  removed from Squeeze, drops emchain but retains
  /usr/share/pdebuild-cross/xapt, which is used inside a pbuilder
  chroot by the pdebuild-cross package.

  To use xapt outside a chroot, use version 2.2.6 or later. Debian
  experimental will have 2.2.6 in due course. The Emdebian toolchain
  repository already has 2.2.6 for unstable.

emdebian-tools (2.2.0) experimental; urgency=low

  The source package and all binary packages have been greatly slimmed
  down so that Emdebian builds rely more on standard Debian tools.

  emdebian-tools has been renamed emdebian-crush and is refocused on
  just implementing functional changes necessary to adapt hand-picked
  Debian packages and then base the rest of the system on Emdebian Grip.

  The previous debconf questions have been removed, there is no longer
  a fixed working directory and the emdebian toolchain archive is no
  longer automatically added to your apt sources. Instead, the new
  emdebian-crush package contains the apt source as a configuration
  file. The apt source is not needed for other packages.

emdebian-tools (1.4.11) unstable; urgency=low

  Two new packages have been created : emdebian-grip and emdebian-tdeb.
  
  emdebian-tdeb will act as a home for various scripts related to TDeb
  support in Debian and Emdebian, including the conversion of Debian
  TDebs into Emdebian TDebs and the creation of a diff1.gz to retain
  the translation sources to support independent uploads. em_installtdeb
  has migrated to the new package and a new script, dpkg-gentdeb has been
  built from the em_installtdeb code to try to create a suitable script
  for dpkg-dev to build Debian TDebs during the course of the normal
  build process. (This requires changes to debian/control by the
  Debian maintainer.)

  emdebian-grip contains emgrip, built from the dpkg-cross code but not
  dependent on either dpkg-cross or libdebian-dpkgcross-perl. This script
  may migrate to a different source package in due course. As yet, it is
  only packaged in /usr/share/emdebian-tools/ as it is not ready for
  mainstream use. Please read the POD content embedded in the script for
  more information on emgrip.

  See http://www.emdebian.org/emdebian/flavours.html for more information
  on Emdebian Grip itself.

emdebian-tools (0.7.3) unstable; urgency=low

  emlocale has been removed from emdebian-tools.

  emlocale has been replaced by em_installtdeb which operates without
  $pkg-locale-$lang files and emdebian-$pkg-locale patch files and without
  changes to debian/control. em_installtdeb runs at the end of the build (acting
  as a second build if the first completes successfully) and the results of the
  em_installtdeb run are checked with the same emdebuild build checks as before.
  This provides a second .changes file, a second .dsc file and a stripped down
  .tdeb.tar.gz tarball containing (hopefully) enough files for translators to
  prepare independent tdeb uploads. Emdebian has support for the necessary
  'locale' repository and the tdeb .changes file must NOT be uploaded to the
  normal Emdebian target repository, neither should tdeb files be uploaded to
  Debian at this time. See em_installtdeb (1).

  This change also means that debian/control patches will disappear for some
  packages, allowing smoother updates.

  Also, gccross support from dpkg-cross is now optional. Most packages will
  build successfully without it. Packages that build and link against internal
  libraries will need to use 'X-Build-Cross-Libtool: yes' in debian/xcontrol.
  See emdebuild (1).
