=head1 Name

pdebuild-cross-create - pbuilder wrapper to create a crossbuild chroot

=head1 Synopsis

 pdebuild-cross-create

=head1 Description

C<pdebuild-cross> wraps pdebuild to support cross-building inside a
pbuilder chroot. C<pdebuild-cross> needs to be run in the top level
source directory of the package (where it can find F<debian/changelog>).

=head1 Options

C<pdebuild-cross-create> supports no options. Edit the
F</etc/pdebuild-cross/pdebuild-cross.rc> configuration file to change how
C<pdebuild-cross-create> behaves.

=head1 Architecture

F</etc/pdebuild-cross/pdebuild-cross.rc> defaults to C<armel> - edit the
F</etc/pdebuild-cross/pdebuild-cross.rc> configuration file to change the
architecture. Ensure that the C<MULTISTRAPFILE> configuration value
is also modified to specify a C<multistrap> configuration file suitable
for the architecture required.

However, the current pbuilder hooks also default to C<armel> and would
need to be replaced for other architectures.
